I've always liked technology and was always curious of how different electronics worked. For the majority of my early childhood and adolescent years, if I wasn't being secretly nerdy playing video games and with action figures at home, I was busy being an athlete.

My whole life I was extremely active, heavy into sports and exercise,  and always thought I was going to be either training athletes, or rehabilitating them.

Torn between the two, I always thought the concept of coding was so cool but way beyond my skillset (sometimes I still think that).

I went to University for exercise science, thinking I was destined to be a Physical Therapist, and I still think I would have been a great one. 

The thing is, everytime I wanted to create something, whether it was a business or product, it always required some sort of techinical skill that I didn't have and would have depended on someone else. This is where my thought about coding and increasing my skillset in programmer reimmerged.

First it was SEO and marketing, for the obvious reasons I needed to reach as many people as possible while being business savvy if I wanted my product/idea to be used by many. That however, didn't solve the actual building process, which then came web development.

I quickly realized web development (being self-taught), also had it's limitations and it was time to take it to the next level.

Here I am today, in FlatIron, learning to be a skilled programmer and hopefully building something really special one day.

Maybe I'll even blend my fitness background one day with my programmer skills and build something that can be used by many people. Either way, it'll be one more major skillset under my belt to feed my entreprenuerial mentality.
